Objective
Develop a simple web application where users can view, add, edit, and delete user details from a mock backend API.
Requirements
User Interface:
Display a list of users with details such as ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Department.
Provide buttons or links to "Add", "Edit", and "Delete" users.
A form to input details of a new user or edit details of an existing user.
Backend Interaction:
Use JSONPlaceholder, a free online REST API that you can use for demonstration and test purposes.
Specifically, use the '/users' endpoint to fetch and manipulate user data.
Functionality:
View: Display all users by fetching data from the '/users' endpoint.
Add: Allow adding a new user by posting to the '/users' endpoint. (Note: JSONPlaceholder won't actually add the user, but will simulate a successful response.)
Edit: Allow editing an existing user. This should involve fetching the current data for a user, allowing for edits, and then putting the updated data back via the API.
Delete: Allow users to be deleted, by sending a delete request to the API.
Error Handling:
Handle scenarios where the API request might fail - show an error message to the user in such cases.
Bonus (Optional):
Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the user list.
Add client-side validation for the user input form.
Make the interface responsive.
Guidelines
Your primary focus should be on functionality. However, a clean UI will be appreciated.
You may use vanilla JavaScript or any JavaScript framework/library of your choice like React, Angular, Vue, etc.
Consider using tools like Axios or Fetch API for HTTP requests.
Ensure the solution is modular and scalable.
Document any assumptions you make.
